# React Ordering App
This is a potential Food Ordering App built with React Js.
The App is currently not fully functional due to some changes were made in order to upgrade the App itself.

## The changes
The App was based on 'useState' and 'lifting state up' method shich of course works yet there are way more efficient ways to do some specific operations.
I have started handling some of the states by using reducers and created a Context-Provider where I will be transfering data around the App through them.
Not all of the necessary changes took place - the App is currently not fully functional.
